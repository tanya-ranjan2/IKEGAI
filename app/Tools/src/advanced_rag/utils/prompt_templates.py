reranking_template='''Relevance measures how well the Context addresses the main aspects of the question, based on the context. Consider whether all and only the important aspects are contained in the Context when evaluating relevance. Given the context and question, score the relevance between one to five stars using the following rating scale: 

            One star: the answer completely lacks relevance 

            Two stars: the answer mostly lacks relevance 

            Three stars: the answer is partially relevant 

            Four stars: the answer is mostly relevant 

            Five stars: the answer has perfect relevance 

            This rating value should always be an integer between 1 and 5. So the rating produced should be 1 or 2 or 3 or 4 or 5.
